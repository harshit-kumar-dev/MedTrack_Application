 * Payload for {@code PATCH /api/equipment/{id}/stock}.

 * <p>Stock movement is expressed as a <em>delta</em> rather than an absolute quantity. Receiving a
 * shipment of 5 units is {@code delta = 5}; consuming 2 is {@code delta = -2}. Two concurrent
 * absolute writes would silently lose one of the movements ("last write wins"), whereas two deltas
 * applied to the same row compose correctly.</p>
 *
 * <p>{@code minimumStock} is optional here so a reorder threshold can be re-tuned in the same call
 * that records a movement, without forcing callers who only want to move stock to restate it.</p>
